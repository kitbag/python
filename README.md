python [Custom Python modules]
------------------------------
A place to stash custom python modules and projects.

# proxpn.py
===========
Module to automate updating and running ProXPN on Linux. Currently they support versions for Windows and Mac, but running on Linux has always been very manual. This is currently a bare-bones, running version, where a lot of the interaction is manual.
## Running
==========
```python
sudo ./proxpn.py
```
## To Do List
=============
1. Add restarting the VPN to the monitoring function
2. Update the main to take arguments as options
3. Optionally enable IP forwarding for gateway mode
